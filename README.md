# Journeyers project: alpha releases

## Android: apk file install

Assuming that you moved the file on Android using USB, I was able to install the apk, from the "Files" app, with:<br> 
"3 dots", "Select", "3 dots", "Open with", "Package installer".
<br>
<br>
Alpha releases for other systems, when feasible outside of an app store, are planned.
